/**
 * Compares two simple semver version strings.
 * This is a very simple comparator that does not implement
 * the complete semver specification! It may have issues when
 * an ASCII string is part of the comparison.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * versionCompare('1.1', '1.2') => -1
 * versionCompare('1.1', '1.1') =>  0
 * versionCompare('1.2', '1.1') =>  1
 * versionCompare('2.23.3', '2.22.3') => 1
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * -1 = left is LOWER than right
 *  0 = both strings are equal
 *  1 = left is GREATER than right
 *  FALSE if at least one of the inputs is not a string.
 *
 * @function
 * @param {String} left - version string
 * @param {String} right - version string
 * @return {Integer|Boolean}
